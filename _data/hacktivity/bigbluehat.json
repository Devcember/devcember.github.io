way this has been done in the past (afaik) is to keep references to the groups of DOM nodes that represent a single annotation--and juggle all the interleaved DOM nodes if/when anything changes. It's beyond inefficient, but it's what happens when you cram to trees together...\r\n\r\nSo, from your example, you'd end up with something like this (pseudo code here also):\r\n```html\r\n<p><mark data-anno-id=\"3\">Something </mark><mark data-anno-id=\"1\"><mark data-anno-id=\"3\"><mark data-anno-id=\"2\">is</mark></mark><mark data-anno-id=\"3\"> here</mark></mark></p>\r\n\r\n<p><mark data-anno-id=\"345\">And there's more text</mark> down here</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLovely, right? 😉 The text in each selection would be:\r\n1. \"is\"\r\n2. \"is here\"\r\n3. \"Something is here And there's more text\"\r\n\r\nPresented as a tree this looks like:\r\n```html\r\n<p>\r\n  <mark data-anno-id=\"3\">Something </mark>\r\n  <mark data-anno-id=\"1\">\r\n    <mark data-anno-id=\"3\">\r\n      <mark data-anno-id=\"2\">is</mark>\r\n    </mark>\r\n    <mark data-anno-id=\"3\"> here</mark>\r\n  </mark>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <mark data-anno-id=\"345\">And there's more text</mark>\r\n  down here\r\n</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe DOM will think of (and treat) several of these `<mark>` tags as parents or children of other `<mark>` tags. The annotation software, however, would treat them as unrelated and remove/add/change their occurrences wherever they're found. Finding them is one thing (`document.querySelectorAll('[data-anno-id=3]`) creating them interleaved inside other stuff is entirely another..."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-11-30T15:36:34Z","org":{"id":47359,"login":"apache","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/apache","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?"}}]
