<p class="message">
Devcember is about giving.
</p>

During the month of Devcember (formerly December), celebrants do the following:

 - **develop**: code, content, community, art
 - **give it away**: creative commons, open source, etc.

Ideally, you report your progress throughout the month somewhere others can
follow along--a blog, a repo, the #devcember hash tag somewhere or other.

The goal is a chronicle of the giving greatness we've done together for these
31 days.
