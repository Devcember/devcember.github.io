Devcember is about giving.
</p>

During the month of December, [celebrants](/celebrants) do the following:

 - **develop**: code, content, community, art
 - **give it away**: creative commons, open source, etc.

Report on your progress throughout the month so others can follow along:
 - Blog about it.
 - Create a repo.
 - Use #devcember on social media.

Our goal is to chronicle the giving greatness we'll do together in these
31 short days.
