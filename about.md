Devcember is about giving.
</p>

During the month of December, [Celebrants](/celebrants) do the following:

 - **pick a spec**: [usually Web related](/specs)
 - **develop (for) it**: create code, content, community
 - **give it away**: open source, creative commons, etc.

Report on your progress throughout the month so others can follow along:
 - Blog about it.
 - Create a repo.
 - Use `#devcember` on social media.

Our goal is to chronicle the giving greatness we'll do together in these
31 short days.
