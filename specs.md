title: Where to find specifications
---

There are three primary sources of Web-related finalized and/or in-progress
specifications:
 - [W3C's Technical Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/) - finalized specs from the [W3C](http://w3.org/)
 - [W3C's Web Incubator](https://wicg.io/) - early stage *ideas* proposed for possible specification
 - [IETF RFC's](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/index) - Internet-focused specs (granted...not all of these are Web-focused)

Also, you might checkout [WebConcepts.info](http://webconcepts.info/) which
aggregates much of the information from the above specs.

There are many, *many* other places to find specifications (Web related or not).

Please feel free to [fork this repo](https://github.com/devcember.github.io/)
and add your favorite spec or list of specs (especially if you plan to
implement or iterate on them!).
